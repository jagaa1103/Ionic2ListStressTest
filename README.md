It's simple Ionic2 project. 

## Try List

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

### I need list with 1000+ items:

Our company develop ionic mobile app. It's works with thermometer device.
Device sends lot of temperature data to mobile and in mobile side shows list of data. 

```bash
1 minute * 60 * 24 hours = 1440 items on my list :()
```
