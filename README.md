It's simple [ionic2](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base). project. 

## Try List

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-app-base).

### I need list with 1000+ items:

Our company develop ionic mobile app. It's works with thermometer device.
Device sends lot of temperature data to mobile and in mobile side shows list of data. 

```bash
1 minute * 60 * 24 hours = 1440 items on my list :()
```

## Done

It's simple but really impressive test for me (tested on GalaxyS4, Android 5.0.1). 
if you run on old phone it's very slow create 1000 and 10000 items on list.

For my case I chose virtualscroll. It's little bit blank screen when I scroll quickly. But it's better than using ngFor.
